Project Overview
This project is meant to provide students the opportunity to demonstrate and practice what they have learned by creating a simple Golf Scorecard. The score card will have all the functionality that a golfer would need such as yardage per hole, par per hole, be able to select the tees wanted etc.

We will be using  API url endpoints to get golf course information. Documentation and a JSON example of course info:

Tips

1 - Overview

This project is going to be a bit more complex than the Todo App you built. It involves more moving parts and it has more requirements. You got this though. If you follow the steps and the tips I will give you in class you will do great. You really donâ€™t need to know golf to get this project done. Just need to learn a couple things about the sport to get the project done. Again, this guide is not going to spell everything out for you but it will give you a good path to success.
